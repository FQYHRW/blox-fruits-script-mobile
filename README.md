### 💻 What Is a Blox Fruits Script?

A **Blox Fruits script** is a specially designed Lua code that integrates with Roblox executors to unlock powerful tools not included in the base game. These tools automate repetitive actions, enhance your vision across the map, and give you precision control over your actions.

Once executed, most scripts launch with a simple in-game GUI (Graphical User Interface), allowing you to toggle settings such as auto attack, fruit ESP, teleport, and more.
